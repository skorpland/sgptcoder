To debug any issues with sgptcoder, you can check the logs or the session data
that it stores locally.

---

### Logs

Log files are written to:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/sgptcoder/log/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\sgptcoder\log\`

Log files are named with timestamps (e.g., `2025-01-09T123456.log`) and the most recent 10 log files are kept.

You can set the log level with the `--log-level` command-line option to get more detailed debug information. For example, `sgptcoder --log-level DEBUG`.

---

### Storage

sgptcoder stores session data and other application data on disk at:

- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.local/share/sgptcoder/`
- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.local\share\sgptcoder`

This directory contains:

- `auth.json` - Authentication data like API keys, OAuth tokens
- `log/` - Application logs
- `project/` - Project-specific data like session and message data
  - If the project is within a Git repo, it is stored in `./<project-slug>/storage/`
  - If it is not a Git repo, it is stored in `./global/storage/`

## Common issues

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them.

---

### sgptcoder won't start

1. Check the logs for error messages
2. Try running with `--print-logs` to see output in the terminal
3. Ensure you have the latest version with `sgptcoder upgrade`

---

### Authentication issues

1. Try re-authenticating with `sgptcoder auth login <provider>`
2. Check that your API keys are valid
3. Ensure your network allows connections to the provider's API

---

### Model not available

1. Check that you've authenticated with the provider
2. Verify the model name in your config is correct
3. Some models may require specific access or subscriptions

---

### ProviderInitError

If you encounter a ProviderInitError, you likely have an invalid or corrupted configuration.

To resolve this:

1. First, verify your provider is set up correctly by following the [providers guide](/docs/providers)
2. If the issue persists, try clearing your stored configuration:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/sgptcoder
   ```

3. Re-authenticate with your provider:
   ```bash
   sgptcoder auth login <provider>
   ```

---

### AI_APICallError and provider package issues

If you encounter API call errors, this may be due to outdated provider packages. sgptcoder dynamically installs provider packages (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) as needed and caches them locally.

To resolve provider package issues:

1. Clear the provider package cache:

   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/sgptcoder
   ```

2. Restart sgptcoder to reinstall the latest provider packages

This will force sgptcoder to download the most recent versions of provider packages, which often resolves compatibility issues with model parameters and API changes.

### Copy/paste not working on Linux

Linux users need to have one of the following clipboard utilities installed for copy/paste functionality to work:

**For X11 systems:**

```bash
apt install -y xclip
# or
apt install -y xsel
```

**For Wayland systems:**

```bash
apt install -y wl-clipboard
```

**For headless environments:**

```bash
apt install -y xvfb
# and run:
Xvfb :99 -screen 0 1024x768x24 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
export DISPLAY=:99.0
```

sgptcoder will detect if you're using Wayland and prefer `wl-clipboard`, otherwise it will try to find clipboard tools in order of: `xclip` and `xsel`.
