description: Configuring an LLM provider and model.
---

sgptcoder uses the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) and [Models.dev](https://models.dev) to support for **75+ LLM providers** and it supports running local models.

---

## Providers

Most popular providers are preloaded by default. If you've added the credentials for a provider through `sgptcoder auth login`, they'll be available when you start sgptcoder.

Learn more about [providers](/docs/providers).

---

## Select a model

Once you've configured your provider you can select the model you want by typing in:

```bash frame="none"
/models
```

---

## Recommended models

There are a lot of models out there, with new models coming out every week.

:::tip
Consider using one of the models we recommend.
:::

However, there are a only a few of them that are good at both generating code and tool calling.

Here are the ones we recommend with sgptcoder:

- Claude Sonnet 4
- Claude Opus 4
- Kimi K2
- Qwen3 Coder
- GPT 4.1
- Gemini 2.5 Pro

---

## Set a default

To set one of these as the default model, you can set the `model` key in your
sgptcoder config.

```json title="sgptcoder.json" {3}
{
  "$schema": "https://sgptcoder.ai/config.json",
  "model": "lmstudio/google/gemma-3n-e4b"
}
```

Here the full ID is `provider_id/model_id`.

If you've configured a [custom provider](/docs/providers#custom), the `provider_id` is key from the `provider` part of your config, and the `model_id` is the key from `provider.models`.

---

## Configure models

You can globally configure a model's options through the config.

```jsonc title="sgptcoder.jsonc" {7-12,19-24}
{
  "$schema": "https://sgptcoder.ai/config.json",
  "provider": {
    "openai": {
      "models": {
        "gpt-5": {
          "options": {
            "reasoningEffort": "high",
            "textVerbosity": "low",
            "reasoningSummary": "auto",
            "include": ["reasoning.encrypted_content"],
          },
        },
      },
    },
    "anthropic": {
      "models": {
        "claude-sonnet-4-20250514": {
          "options": {
            "thinking": {
              "type": "enabled",
              "budgetTokens": 16000,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Here we're configuring global settings for two models: `gpt-5` when accessed via the `openai` provider, and `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` when accessed via the `anthropic` provider.

You can also configure these options for any agents that you are using. The agent config overrides any global options here. [Learn more](/docs/agents/#additional).

## Loading models

When sgptcoder starts up, it checks for models in the following priority order:

1. The `--model` or `-m` command line flag. The format is the same as in the config file: `provider_id/model_id`.

2. The model list in the sgptcoder config.

   ```json title="sgptcoder.json"
   {
     "$schema": "https://sgptcoder.ai/config.json",
     "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"
   }
   ```

   The format here is `provider/model`.

3. The last used model.

4. The first model using an internal priority.
